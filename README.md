.desktop linux application template
---------------------------------------

Because I haven't found any easy method for creating .desktop files in linux without copy and paste other .desktop file in my system I have made this template.

`boilr` is a useful tool for creating projects or files using templates uploaded to a Github repository.

You can download [boilr from here](https://github.com/tmrts/boilr).

After to install, you can download this template and use it later.

```bash
boilr template download sevir/boilerplate-dotdesktop dotdesktop
boilr tempalte use dotdesktop ~/local/share/applications
```
